mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/

Edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf and add the following:

        Option "RTCornerButton" "0"
        Option "RBCornerButton" "0"
        Option "LTCornerButton" "0"
        Option "LBCornerButton" "0"
        Option "ClickFinger1" "0"
        Option "ClickFinger2" "0"
        Option "ClickFinger3" "0"

to the following section:

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad catchall"
        Driver "synaptics"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"

and reboot. You can use synclient to set the above options without having to reboot.

This seems to disable all of the extraneous tapping I was seeing.
